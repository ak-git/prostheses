It is found that muscle contraction leads to proportional changing in active and reactive impedance components. This is reflected in anti-phase impedance signals behavior from antagonist muscles during wrist grasp process. Experimentally established difference between “grasp” and “rotation” signals. Impedance signals are in-phase during wrist rotation process. This difference makes it possible to determine wrist grasp and rotation in real time.

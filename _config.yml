  This work is dedicated neuromuscular interface, which is based on electrical impedance 
  and surface electromyogram registered together. 
  Active part of impedance is registered non-invasively using tetrapolar electrode system 
  from a segment of the upper limb. 
  Impedance signals are proportional to the movementâ€™s extent. 
  In contrast to other techniques, this approach allows anthropomorphic bioelectric prosthesis control.

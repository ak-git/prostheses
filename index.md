Muscle contraction leads to proportional changing in electric impedance components. This is reflected in **anti-phase** impedance signals behavior from antagonist muscles during wrist grasp process. Experimentally established difference between “grasp” and “rotation” signals. Impedance signals are **in-phase** during wrist rotation process. This difference makes it possible to determine wrist grasp and rotation in real time.
